satnet-ng
================
AngularJS application that implements an user interface for the services of the SATNet network.

USAGE
================
The files under the "dist" directory are a frozen version. Current development version is no longer included compiled within "dist" since it is expected to be integrated in a CDN hosted domain. Whoever wants to use the latest available version, should generate the "dist" directory by him/herself using Grunt with the already included gruntfile.

LICENSE
================
Apache version 2.0.
